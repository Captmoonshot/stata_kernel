On macOS and Linux, this controls the Stata console directly, which prevents speed degradation with larger data sets. In contrast, ipystata saves the data set to disk after each code cell, slowing execution. This is also a pure Jupyter kernel, whereas ipystata is a Jupyter \"magic\" within the Python kernel. This means that you don't need to have any knowledge of Python* and don't need to have packages like Pandas installed. * Python is amazing language, and if you want to move on to bigger data, I highly recommend learning Python.","title":"Comparison with ipystata"},{"location":"comparison_with_ipystata/#comparison-with-ipystata","text":"Except for Windows, this package takes a different approach to communication with Stata.

The install step should have found your executable if you installed it in the standard location. If you receive a warning during the install step, you'll need to manually find the location of Stata and add it to this file. execution_mode : For macOS users, this allows for setting the method in which stata_kernel communicates with Stata. automation uses Stata Automation while console controls the console version of Stata. console is the default because it allows for multiple independent sessions of Stata to run at the same time. automation may be useful if you wish to browse the data interactively with browse . On Windows, all communication with Stata happens through Stata Automation, and on Linux/Unix all communication happens through the console. cache_directory : the directory for the kernel to store temporary log files and graphs. By default, this is ~/.stata_kernel_cache , where ~ means your home directory. You may wish to change this location if, for example, you're working under a Data Use Agreement where all related files must be stored in a specific directory. graph_format : the format to export and display graphs.

In order to install the kernel, Python >= 3.5 needs to be installed. I suggest installing the Anaconda distribution , which doesn't require administrator privileges and is simple to install. If you want to use less disk space, install Miniconda , which includes few packages other than Python. Windows only: Install pywin32 , which lets Python talk to Stata. Choose the version of Python you have installed: Python 3.5 Python 3.6 Python 3.7 Link the Stata Automation library . The Stata executable is most likely in the folder C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Stata15 . In the installation directory, right-click on the Stata executable, for example, StataSE.exe . Choose Create Shortcut . Right-click on the newly created Shortcut to StataSE.exe , choose Property , and change the target from \"C:\\Program Files\\Stata15\\StataSE.exe\" to \"C:\\Program Files\\Stata15\\StataSE.exe\" /Register . Click OK . Right-click on the updated Shortcut to StataSE.exe ; choose Run as administrator . Package Install \u00b6 To install the kernel, run: $ pip install stata_kernel --upgrade $ python -m stata_kernel.install The latter command will try to find the path to your Stata executable, and will warn you if it can't. If it can't find your Stata executable, go to Configuration to see how to set it yourself.","title":"Installing"},{"location":"user_guide/install/#installation","text":"","title":"Installation"},{"location":"user_guide/install/#prerequisites","text":"Python .
