about: Create a report to help us improve

#### Code Sample

<!-- Should be a copy-pastable example if possible -->

```stata
// Your code here

```
#### Problem description

<!--
This should explain **why** the current behavior is a problem and why the expected output is a better solution.

**Note**: Many problems can be resolved by simply upgrading `stata_kernel` to the latest version. Before submitting, please check if that solution works for you.
-->

#### Expected Output

#### Debugging log

<!--
If you're using `console` mode, there should be a file named
~/.stata_kernel_cache/console_debug.log. This is helpful to see for debugging
information. Note that this has all the commands and output up to where the
program crashed.
 -->

#### Package Version

<!-- You can find the package version with `pip show stata_kernel` -->
