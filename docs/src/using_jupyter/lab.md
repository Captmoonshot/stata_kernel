# JupyterLab

Jupyter Lab is the successor to [Jupyter Notebook](notebook.md), and allows for having multiple documents side-by-side.

As of early December 2018, there is not yet syntax highlighting for Stata in Jupyter lab.

You can start this by running:

```
jupyter lab
```

in your terminal or command prompt. Just like the Notebook, this should open up a page in your browser, where you can open a new Stata notebook or console.
