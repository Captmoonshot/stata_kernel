# Jupyter Notebook

You can start the Jupyter Notebook server by running

```
jupyter notebook
```

in your terminal or command prompt. That should open up your browser to the
Jupyter home screen. Click the *New*  drop down menu in the top right and choose
`Stata` from the list to start a new notebook using Stata as your default
kernel.
