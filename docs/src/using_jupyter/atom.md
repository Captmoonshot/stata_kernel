# Atom

Download the [Atom text editor](https://atom.io) and install the
[Hydrogen](https://atom.io/packages/hydrogen), and
[language-stata](https://atom.io/packages/language-stata) packages. The first
connects to Jupyter kernels and allows you to view results in-line
next to your code. You can use it with Python, R, and Julia, as well as Stata. The latter provides syntax highlighting for Stata code.

Once those are installed, open a do-file and run <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>-<kbd>Enter</kbd> (<kbd>Cmd</kbd>-<kbd>Enter</kbd> on macOS) to start the Stata kernel.
