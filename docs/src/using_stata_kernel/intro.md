# Using the Stata Kernel

The Stata kernel is the bridge between Stata and the Jupyter ecosystem. It will work with any of the tools outlined in [Using Jupyter](../using_jupyter/intro.md).

After [installing](../getting_started.md) and optionally [configuring](../getting_started.md#configuration) `stata_kernel`, it should be ready for use.
